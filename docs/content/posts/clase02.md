Environment Setup

<!-- Dear instructor:
* The dates at the top of this markdown (.md) document will help order the classes in the portal.
Please, if you don't need to, do not change the one that is now.
* Take into account that there is a feature in the dates: if you use a date in the future, the class will be not visible in the portal until the date you have assigned.
* You can create dedicated folders if you need to.
* But if you simply need to add some pictures, you can use the folder ../static/img/ mentioned at the top as /school2021/img/

# Environment Setup

The installation of the ESCAPE school environment will be described and implemented from scratch in this hands-on session. 
We will go through the installation of conda - an open source package management system - and the dependencies needed to 
follow the lectures of the summer school.
